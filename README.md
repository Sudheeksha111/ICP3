Using the use case in the class: a.Checking how the accuracy changes by adding more Dense layers to the existing code and . 2. Changing the data source to Breast Cancer dataset and reporting accuracy of the model. 3. Normalizing the data before feeding the data to the model and checking how the normalization changes the accuracy. Using image classification on the hand written digits data set (mnist) 1. Plotting the loss and accuracy for both training data and validation data using the history object in the source code. 2. Plotting one of the images in the test data, and then inferencing to check what is the prediction of the model on that single image. 3. We had used 2 hidden layers and Relu activation. 4. Running the same code without scaling the images and performance checking.
